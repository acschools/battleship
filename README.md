Battleship bootcamp challenge: Javascript and Jquery
This was our first full javascript project after one week of Javascript Intro and two days of jQuery. It was a very challenging project spread over three days of pair programming. To begin, we created the gameboard with a for loop. We started with one ship of one "block", expanded into 5 ships of one block each, and then 8 ships of varying block sizes. One of the tricky parts was figuring out how to not let the ships touch. We also included CSS to display the status of the "hits" and "misses", as well as keeping a count of torpedoes to show when the player has won or lost. 

This version of the game is almost done, but at this point the ships are only able to be placed horizontally. I hope to update the functionality with vertical ships to make the game a little harder to win!
